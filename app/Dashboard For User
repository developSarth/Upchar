⭐ GOAL

When a user opens the Dashboard, the backend should retrieve:

Latest summary

Symptom history

Visit history

Bookings

Medicine scans

Personal analytics

All from your database only — NOT from the LLM, NOT from RAG.

# This keeps dashboard:
✔ Fast
✔ Reliable
✔ Cheap
✔ Always available
✔ Independent of AI agent runtime
Every time a user uses your AI:

Save:
uid
symptoms (list)
severity (selected or suggested)
llm_full_output
llm_summary
timestamp


This makes dashboard retrieval instant and clean
